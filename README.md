# LangChain Practical Projects

This repository contains hands-on advanced NLP and retrieval tasksâ€”such as structured data extraction, API querying, and semantic document search.
LangChain is a powerful framework for building applications that connect large language models (LLMs) with external data and APIs.  
These notebooks provide practical examples of how to use LangChain for parsing JSON outputs, integrating with APIs, and searching across document collections, helping you build smarter, more interactive AI solutions.

## Notebooks Included

- **Langchain_using_Jsonparsers.ipynb**  
  Learn how to extract structured information from LLMs using LangChain's built-in JSON parsers.

- **LangchainAPI_usage_queries.ipynb**  
  Practical example of leveraging LangChain for calling APIs and answering questions using dynamic external data.

- **document_search_resumes_Langchain.ipynb**  
  Use LangChain to search and retrieve information from resume documents using semantic search.

## Applications

- **Structured Data Extraction:**  
  Turn unstructured LLM outputs into reliable, structured JSON for further processing.

- **Dynamic API Integration:**  
  Build smart assistants that can call APIs for up-to-date information.

- **Semantic Document Search:**  
  Search and analyze resume or document databases using advanced retrieval.
